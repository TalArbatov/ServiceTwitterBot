# ServiceTwitterBot

I made this bot to represent how many days, hours, minutes and seconds I have until I am free from the army.

## How it works

I used the Twit library to generate new twits, the bot generates a new twit hour and calculates the time difference
I have between the time the tweet is published to the day I end my service
